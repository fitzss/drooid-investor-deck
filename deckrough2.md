# 🛰️ Slide 1: The Mission
**Title:** Rearming the Edge - Overnight  
**Subtitle:**  
Drooid turns every unit lab into its own Blue-compliant drone factory.  
No shipping. No wait. Just print, snap, and fly.

---

## ❗ Slide 2: The Problem – DoD Last‑Mile Bottleneck  

- **DIU & Project G.I. (2025):** “Unit‑level labs must be able to redesign and produce airframes themselves.”  
- **Project G.I. (Jun 2025):** “Ready now, less exquisite sUAS scalable in weeks.”  
  - *Speed and simplicity beat extra features.*  
- **Replicator mandate:** Thousands of attritable drones per quarter  

**Reality today**  
- 8–20 week delays for replacement frames  
- No way to customize or manufacture in the field  
- Compliance and SBOM paperwork slow every iteration  

> **Central factories cannot deliver autonomy at the edge.**

---

# 📈 Slide 3: Market Urgency & Stated Demand
**Title:** An Urgent Gap at Scale

- **700+ DoD unit labs** already own SLS or MJF printers
- **Group 1–2 UAS spend ≈ $4B/year** (DoD-wide)
- DIU’s **Replicator Initiative**: field thousands of systems per quarter
- Shift **10% of drone frame volume** to on-base printing = **$400M wedge**
- **No vendor today** enables this workflow

> This is not a niche. It's a defined, funded gap with no software-native supplier.

---

# 🌏 Slide 4: Indo-Pacific Logistics Pressure Point
**Title:** Why the Pacific Needs Drooid

- Indo-Pac combatant commands can’t wait 12 weeks for replacement drones
- Edge autonomy = logistics independence
- Central factory shipping timelines break readiness
- Unit labs already operate Formlabs Fuse, Markforged, and LUMA spaces

> Drooid enables local replenishment and adaptation on the same base. A game changer for the Pacific theater.

---

# 🧰 Slide 5: The Job to Be Done
**Title:** “Print Tonight, Fly Tomorrow”

- Unit labs already print brackets and antennas
- But they **can’t produce flight-safe, Blue-compliant airframes** without:
  - Weeks of cyber audit friction
  - Vendor-controlled SBOM pipelines
  - Central QA delay

> The job is rapid, local, compliant airframe production. Not “another better drone.”

# 🔒 Slide 6: The Capability Gap
**Title:** What Prime Vendors Can’t Solve

| **Vendor Model**                  | **Drooid Model**                              |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Central factory & tooling        | Local SLS printing in unit labs               |
| Hardware-driven margins          | Software licensing + modular rail kits        |
| Closed SBOM / avionics           | Auto-generated, cryptographically signed SBOM |
| 8–20 week frame lead-time        | < 24 hr print-to-flight loop                  |

> This is the Innovator’s Dilemma. Primes can’t cannibalize their model.

---

# 🛠️ Slide 7: The Solution
**Title:** Forge-to-Flight in One Duty Shift

**Drooid Stack:**
- **Forge CLI** → Parametric STL/STEP + signed SBOM in 3 minutes
- **SLS Printer** → Frame prints in 6 hours
- **Rail Kit** → Snap-fit Blue electronics, no soldering
- **Provisioning** → USB-C script flashes firmware & logs TPM hash
- **Hover Test** → Airworthy by nightfall

> **No factory. No freight. No waiting.**  
Just the factory software that replaces factories.

## 🚧 Slide 8 · Prototype Progress  
**Title:** Turning Newlab Detroit into the First Field Factory**

| Milestone | Status | Proof |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| TRL‑6 core stack built (Forge v0, rail, flash script) | ✅ Done | Video link & GitHub hash |
| 24‑Hour “Forge‑to‑Flight” loop | 🔜 Demo Q4 2025 | Formlabs Fuse 1 & Markforged printers on site |
| Cost to replicate a lab setup | <$25 K capex | Includes printer rental & starter rail kits |
| Success KPI | 10 identical frames printed, flashed & hovered in one duty shift | Logged SBOM & TPM hash for each frame |

> **Goal:** In six months any brigade lab can film the same loop and email the SBOM to DIU—no factory required.

# 📦 Slide 9: Next Milestones & Raise

**Title:** Let’s Build the Prototype the Pentagon Asked For

- 🛠️ **Milestone:**  
  Print-to-hover demo proving local, compliant drone production in <24 hours

- 📜 **Pilot support letter secured**  
  from active DoD unit aligned with DIU’s “unit-level labs” requirement

- 🧾 Full documentation + DIU-aligned pilot submission  
  (target: SBIR Phase I, Q1 2026)

- 💵 **Raise:**  
  Seeking up to **$250,000** on a **$3M SAFE** valuation cap


**Tagline:**  
> “We’re not trying to out-Skydio Skydio.  
> We’re enabling the factory that builds what comes next.”
