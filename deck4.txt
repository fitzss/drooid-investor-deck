# 🛰️ Drooid – Software‑Defined Drone Factories for Unit Labs
*(Investor Deck – July 2025, fully updated flow)*

---

## 🚀 Slide 1: The Mission  
**Title:** Rearming the Edge – Overnight  

Drooid turns every unit lab into its own Blue‑compliant drone factory.  
No shipping. No wait. Just print, snap, and fly.

---

#  # ❗ Slide 2: The Problem  
**Title:** The DoD Last-Mile Bottleneck – and Why DoD Documents Call for Local Manufacture  

- **DIU & Project G.I. (2025):** “Unit-level labs must be able to redesign and produce airframes themselves.”  
- **Project G.I. (Jun 2025):** “Ready now, less exquisite sUAS scalable in weeks.”  
  - *Speed and simplicity beat extra features.*  
- **Replicator mandate:** Thousands of attritable drones per quarter

**Reality today:**  
- 8–20 week delays for replacement frames  
- No way to customize or manufacture in the field  
- Compliance and SBOM paperwork slow every iteration  

> **Central factories cannot deliver autonomy at the edge.**


---

## 🏛️ Slide 2: Official Demand & Job To Be Done  
**Title:** DoD Mandate + The 24‑Hour Task  

**Official demand**  
- DIU Blue sUAS Block 4: “Unit‑level labs must be able to redesign and produce airframes themselves.”  
- Replicator: “Ready‑now, less‑exquisite drones scalable in weeks.”

**Job To Be Done** – *“Print tonight, fly tomorrow.”*

| Context | Task | Constraint |
|---------|------|------------|
| Cracked frame after landing | Produce flight‑safe replacement by morning | No soldering, no CAD deep‑dive, zero shipping |

---
## 🌌 Slide 1.5: The Bigger Vision  
**Title:** A Drone Factory in Every Platoon  

> **2030 goal:** Any allied unit can print, certify, and fly a mission‑ready drone the same day a new threat appears.  

- Thousands of micro‑factories replace today’s handful of mega‑plants  
- Mission‑tailored drones born at the edge — zero shipping, zero foreign dependency  
- **Software licences, not hardware trucks, power allied air autonomy**

---

## 📈 Slide 3: Market Scale & Urgency  
**Title:** A Funded Gap Too Big to Ignore  

- **700+ DoD unit labs** already own SLS / MJF printers  
- **Group 1–2 UAS spend ≈ $4 B/yr** (DoD‑wide)  
- **Replicator Initiative:** thousands of attritable drones per quarter  
- Shifting **10 %** of frame volume to on‑base printing = **$400 M wedge**  
- **No vendor today** enables this workflow  

> This is not a niche. It’s a defined, funded gap with no software‑native supplier.

---

## 🔒 Slide 4: Capability Gap – Why Incumbents Can’t Pivot  

| Key Point | Big Prime Vendors | Tier‑Two Integrators | **Drooid** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|------------|
| How frames are built | Central carbon / injection factory | Import low‑cost shells, add U.S. radios | 3‑D‑print nylon shells in the lab |
| Wait time for frame | 8–20 weeks | 4–12 weeks | < 24 hours |
| Cyber compliance | Closed SBOM pipeline | Manual spreadsheets | SBOM auto‑generated & signed on site |
| Business model | $15k–$60k hardware ASP | Program‑of‑record kit sales | Recurring licence + rail kits |
| Edge autonomy | Must reorder | Still wait on shipping | Print, snap, fly tonight |

> **Innovator’s Dilemma:** Releasing STLs collapses prime margins. Drooid’s software thrives on self‑manufacture.

---

## 🌏 Slide 5: Strategic Drivers – Why Timing Is Critical  

- **Indo‑Pacific logistics:** 30–60 day sea‑lift for spares; contested ports delay readiness.  
- **Factory‑floor cyber risk:** One ransomware hit can halt an entire drone line; CMMC & SBOM audits choke throughput.  

> Future conflicts demand distributed, cyber‑resilient, on‑island manufacturing. Drooid answers both threats.

---

## 🛡️ Slide 6: First Pilot Sites & Mission‑Critical Jobs  

| Service / Unit | Lab Gear on Hand | Job They Can’t Do Today | Drooid Unlock |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Army – 82nd Airborne I‑Lab** (Fort Liberty) | Formlabs Fuse 1, Bantam CNC | Swap nose to new IR sensor before night op; wait 8 wks | Overnight print delivers Blue‑compliant frame by 0600 |
| **Navy – DDG Maker Space** (USS Arleigh Burke) | Markforged X7 | Salt corrosion cracks air‑frame at sea; no spares | Print nylon shell on board, snap Blue electronics, continue patrol |
| **Marine Corps – LUMA Cell** (Camp Pendleton) | HP MJF 4200 | Urban exercise burns attritable drones nightly | Parallel prints + rail kits; hover‑test before dawn |
| **Air Force – Hill AFB Depot** | EOS P110 | Prototype new payload rail; cyber approval takes weeks | SBOM auto‑signed on site; depot flies same shift |

> **Common denominator:** Printers + talent exist. Drooid supplies the compliant 24‑h loop.

## 🛠️ Slide 7: Solution Overview – Forge‑to‑Flight in One Duty Shift  

1. **Forge CLI** – parametric nylon frame + signed SBOM in 3 min  
2. **Slicer** – STL → layer file  
3. **SLS Printer** – nylon shell in 6 h  
4. **Rail Snap** – NDAA Blue electronics, no solder  
5. **TPM Flash** – firmware + SBOM hash logged  
6. **Hover Test** – airworthy by evening

No factory. No freight. Just software and a printer already on base.

---

## 🔧 Slide 8: Tech Architecture – CAD Prompt to Flight  

Prompt → Forge CLI (parametric + SBOM) → Slicer → SLS Printer → Rail Snap → TPM flash + hover  

- SBOM cryptographically signed before print  
- Hash stored in TPM; proof travels with aircraft  
- Works offline; no external network required  

---
## 🚧 Slide 9: Prototype Path – 6‑Month Build Plan

| Milestone | Target | Proof |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Forge CLI v0 + rail + flash script | ✔ Complete | Demo clip & repo hash |
| 24 h print‑to‑hover demo @ Newlab Detroit | Q4 2025 | Fuse 1 + Markforged live video |
| KPI | 10 frames printed, flashed & hovered in same shift | SBOM + TPM hash each |

**Goal:** Replicate loop in pilot labs and submit DIU Phase I SBIR (Q1 2026).

---

## 📊 Slide 10: Market Size – TAM / SAM / SOM

| Metric | Definition | $ Value |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **TAM** | All DoD Group 1–2 drones, spares, payloads | ≈ $4 B / yr |
| **SAM** | First 10 % of frames moving to on‑base printing | ≈ $400 M / yr |
| **SOM (3 yr)** | 250 labs @ $50 k licence + rail kits | ≈ $65 M ARR |

---

## 🚀 Slide 11: Strategic Outcome & Exit Paths

- **Phase 1:** 250 US labs → ~$12 M ARR  
- **Phase 2:** NATO & Indo‑Pac allies → >$50 M ARR  
- **Phase 3:** Payload marketplace & rail royalties → >$100 M blended ARR  

**Logical buyers:** Anduril, Firestorm, AeroVironment, Skydio — each needs edge‑factory capability but can’t cannibalize core margins.

---

## 💸 Slide 12: Ask & Next Milestones

**Raise:** $250 k SAFE at $3 M cap  

**Funds drive:**  
- Live hover demo & compliance loop  
- Pilot letter and DIU Phase I submission  

> “We’re not trying to out‑Skydio Skydio. We’re enabling the factory that builds what comes next.”
