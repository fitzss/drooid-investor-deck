# 🛰️ Drooid  
**Instant Drone Factories for Front‑Line Labs**  
*Print → Snap → Hover in 24 hours*  
*(Investor Deck · July 2025)*

---

## The Mission  
**Title:** Rearming the Edge – Overnight  

Drooid turns every unit lab into its own Blue‑compliant drone factory.  
No shipping. No wait. Just print, snap, and fly.

<sub>¹Blue = NDAA‑approved parts list</sub>

---

## The DoD’s New Bottleneck – No Local Drone Manufacturing  

- **Blue sUAS Block 4 RFI (Apr 2025)**  
  “Unit‑level labs must be able to redesign and produce air‑frames themselves.”  
  *Implication → Local CAD‑to‑print loop is mandatory.*  

- **Project G.I. launch (Jun 2025)**  
  “Ready‑now, less‑exquisite sUAS scalable in weeks.”  
  *Speed & simplicity beat new features; frames must be field‑built.*  

- **Replicator Initiative FY‑26 objective**  
  Thousands of attritable systems per quarter via distributed production.

## Market Misdiagnosis – More Factories ≠ Mission-Ready Drones

| “Hype” Talking Point | Ground Truth from DoD Docs |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **“Re‑shore more drone factories.”** | Most plants are already on‑shore; the choke‑point is **8 – 20 week delivery** to front‑line labs (Blue sUAS RFI).
| **“Just ship more finished airframes.”** | Blue sUAS Block 4: **Unit labs must redesign and print frames themselves** in < 24 h. |
| **“Tariffs will fix it.”** | Cost is secondary; lead‑time and cyber vetting are the blockers (Replicator & Project G.I.). |

> Central megaplants still ship by truck or sea‑lift and miss the 24‑hour edge timeline.  
> DoD now asks for **local, cyber‑verified manufacturing inside unit labs.**

---

## Job to Be Done — Inside a Unit Lab  

| Situation | Task | Must‑Haves |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Cracked frame after hard landing | Flight‑safe replacement before first light | No soldering, zero shipping |
| New payload at 1700 | Integrate & launch before dawn raid | SBOM auto‑signed, no vendor queue |

**24‑hour success bar:** CAD tweak → hover with SBOM auto‑signed on site.

---

## Market Scale & Urgency — A Funded Gap Too Big to Ignore  

- **700 + DoD unit labs** already own SLS / MJF printers (CapEx is sunk)  
- **Group 1–2 sUAS spend ≈ $4 B / yr**  
  *(FY‑25 procurement + sustainment lines across Army, USMC, USAF, Navy, SOCOM)*  
- **Replicator mandate:** thousands of attritable drones every quarter  
- **DIU business‑case target:** shift **10 %** of frames to on‑base printing  
- **Budget unlocked:**  

> $4 B annual spend
> × 10 % local‑print phase‑1
> = $400 M service‑addressable wedge
> Gap: No vendor today delivers a full, Blue‑compliant lab tool‑chain

## What Is a Unit Lab?

| Asset on site | Example gear | Already funded |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Industrial SLS / MJF printer | Formlabs Fuse 1, Markforged X7 | ✔ |
| Bench CNC & re‑work | Bantam Tools, Hakko FX‑888 | ✔ |
| 2‑4 tech soldiers | Warrant officer + enlisted makers | ✔ |

*A unit lab is a “maker space in uniform.”*  
Every brigade, ship, or depot already owns the tools above and turns out brackets, radio mounts, and antenna housings every day.

## Why Unit Labs Are the Pivot Point

| Pain | Central Factory | **With Drooid stack** |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Replace cracked frame | 8–20 wk reorder | < 24 h print & fly |
| Indo‑Pac resupply | 30–60 day sea‑lift | Same‑base print |
| Cyber compliance | Manual SBOM audit | Auto‑signed SBOM |
| Iterate design | Vendor queue | Tech edits CAD, prints overnight |

**Take‑away**  
The bottleneck is *not* more megaplants.  
It is giving these already funded labs the software stack to print Blue‑compliant airframes on demand.  
That stack is Drooid.

## What Unit Labs Have vs. What They Still Need  

| In‑Lab Today (sunk cost) | Still Missing | Why It Matters |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| SLS / MJF printer        | Certified drop‑in parts kit | No CapEx hurdle |
| Nylon powder on shelf    | One‑click cyber paperwork   | Gear already at Indo‑Pac bases |
| 2–4 tech soldiers        | Software to go from CAD to flight in < 24 h | Air‑gapped, cleared staff—secure under cyber attack |

---

## Proposed Solution — Software Stack Built for Unit Labs  

Drooid equips the gear and people that already exist:

1. **Forge CLI** — 3‑min parametric frame & signed SBOM  
2. **Blue Rail Kit** — snap‑fit avionics, zero soldering  
3. **TPM write‑back** — firmware + SBOM hash before first flight  
4. **Offline by design** — air‑gapped printers already in the lab  
5. **Licence + cryptographic binding** — every frame tied to Forge key 

Design → print → hover in under a duty shift.  
That closes the 8–20 week gap central factories can’t touch.

---

## Prototype Roadmap  

| Phase & Output | Proof |
|---------------|-------|
| Forge CLI v0 + rail + flash script | Demo clip · Git hash (data‑room link) |
| 24 h print‑to‑hover demo (Newlab Detroit) | Live video |
| Field KPI 10 frames / shift | SBOM + TPM hash each |

Goal: replicate loop in pilot labs and file Blue sUAS & DIU SBIR Phase I.

## Why Incumbents Can’t Pivot, but Drooid Can  

|                       | Big Primes | Tier‑2 Integrators | **Drooid** |
|-----------------------|------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Build method**      | Central factory molding | Import cheap shells | Print in‑lab |
| **Lead‑time**         | 8‑20 weeks | 4‑12 weeks | **< 24 hours** |
| **Compliance + $$**   | Closed SBOM, $15k‑$60k HW margins | Manual SBOM, kit margins | Auto‑SBOM, licence + rail fees |
| **Edge autonomy**     | Re‑order every break | Still wait on shipping | Print • Snap • Fly |

> Drooid’s software wins when units self‑manufacture.

## Future Impact – A Drone Factory in Every Platoon  

> **2030 vision:** Any allied unit prints, certifies, and flies a mission‑ready drone the same day a new threat appears.

- Thousands of micro‑factories replace today’s handful of mega‑plants  
- Mission‑tailored drones born at the edge — zero sea‑lift, zero foreign dependency  
- **Software licences, not hardware trucks, power allied air autonomy**

---
## From First Print to Full Swarm

| **Starting Point** | **Next‑Gen Variants** | **Scaling Potential** |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Initial prototype**<br>Blue‑compliant nano quad “bee” (≈ 250 g) printed overnight | **Mission‑tuned bodies**<br>• Crawlers for tunnels<br>• Swimmers for hull scans<br>• All reuse the same rail core | **Full library**<br>Edge‑printed land·sea·air library|

> 🛠️ **One software stack + rail core scales across all domains.**


---

## Market Size  

| Metric | Definition | Value |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **TAM** | All DoD Group 1‑2 drones | ≈ $4 B / yr |
| **SAM** | First 10 % shift to labs | ≈ $400 M / yr |
| **SOM (3 yr)** | 250 labs × ($50 k licence + $210 k rail) | ≈ $65 M ARR |

---

## Offer & Funding Plan  

- **Raise:** $100 k SAFE at $1 M cap  
- Use of funds: live hover demo • compliance loop • pilot letter • rail‑kit tooling

> “We’re not trying to out‑Skydio Skydio. It's about giving every unit the power to manufacture drones where and when they’re needed.”
